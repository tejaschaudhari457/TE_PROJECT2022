Why Raspberry Pi Pico for This Project?

Cost-Effective: Raspberry Pi Pico is an affordable microcontroller compared to other alternatives like Arduino or ESP32, making it a great choice for cost-sensitive projects.

Low Power Consumption: The low power consumption ensures that it can be deployed in systems that require continuous monitoring (e.g., public health monitoring in offices, hospitals).

MicroPython Support: It supports MicroPython, which makes coding easier and faster for rapid development. Libraries like machine, uasyncio, and I2C in MicroPython simplify sensor interfacing.

GPIO Flexibility: With 26 GPIO pins, the Pico can interface with various sensors, displays, and external devices needed for face mask detection and temperature monitoring.

Hardware Connections:
To interface the Raspberry Pi Pico with the MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor, a camera module, and an LCD display, you will need to make several hardware connections.

1. Camera Module (e.g., USB Camera or ESP32-CAM):
USB Camera: If you are using a USB camera, you will typically connect it to the Raspberry Pi Pico via a USB host interface. However, since Pico does not have native USB host support, an alternative like an ESP32-CAM (which has built-in Wi-Fi and a camera) can be used instead. The ESP32-CAM can send the video feed wirelessly to the Raspberry Pi Pico for processing.
Connection: If using an ESP32-CAM, connect the ESP32-CAM to the Raspberry Pi Pico via UART for communication.

2. MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor:
The MLX90614 is an infrared temperature sensor used to measure the body temperature without physical contact. It communicates over I2C, which makes it easy to interface with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Connections:
VCC (Power) → 3.3V pin on Raspberry Pi Pico
GND (Ground) → GND pin on Raspberry Pi Pico
SDA (Data) → GPIO 16 (SDA) pin on Raspberry Pi Pico
SCL (Clock) → GPIO 17 (SCL) pin on Raspberry Pi Pico
Note: The Pico operates at 3.3V, which is within the operating range of the MLX90614 sensor.

3. LCD Display (e.g., 16x2 LCD or TFT Display):
An LCD or TFT display will be used to show the status of the system, such as "Access Granted" or "Access Denied." For this example, let's use a 16x2 LCD display, which communicates via I2C.

Connections:
VCC (Power) → 5V pin on Raspberry Pi Pico (since 5V is typically required for the LCD)
GND (Ground) → GND pin on Raspberry Pi Pico
SDA (Data) → GPIO 16 (SDA) pin on Raspberry Pi Pico
SCL (Clock) → GPIO 17 (SCL) pin on Raspberry Pi Pico
4. Optional: Buzzer or LED (for Access Indication):
A buzzer or LED can be added to indicate the access status (e.g., green for access granted, red for denied).

Connections:
Buzzer: Connect to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 15) on Raspberry Pi Pico.
LED: Connect to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 14) through a current-limiting resistor.

Connection Summary Table:
Component	Raspberry Pi Pico Pin	Connection Type
MLX90614 Sensor	VCC → 3.3V	Power
GND → GND	Ground
SDA → GPIO 16	I2C Data
SCL → GPIO 17	I2C Clock
Camera Module	UART (TX/RX) → GPIO pins (if using ESP32-CAM)	UART Data
LCD Display	VCC → 5V	Power
GND → GND	Ground
SDA → GPIO 16	I2C Data
SCL → GPIO 17	I2C Clock
Buzzer/LED	GPIO 14/15	Output (digital)


Programming and Code Execution:
The MicroPython code will be used to control all the sensors and peripherals.
For the MLX90614 sensor, you'll use the machine library to read data via I2C.
For face mask detection, you will process images from the camera using the OpenCV library and a trained model (MobileNetV2 with TensorFlow/Keras).
The decision-making code will check both the mask detection status and the body temperature before displaying the result on the LCD and triggering the buzzer or LED.


Conclusion:
The Raspberry Pi Pico is an ideal choice for the "Face Mask Detection with Body Temperature Measurement" project due to its versatility, low cost, and MicroPython support. By using the Pico, you can easily interface with various sensors and peripherals like the MLX90614 temperature sensor, camera module, and LCD display to build a comprehensive, automated health compliance system.
