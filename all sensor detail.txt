Sensors Used in the Project:

In the Face Mask Detection with Body Temperature Measurement project, we are using two main sensors:

MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor – for body temperature measurement.
Camera Module (e.g., USB or ESP32-CAM) – for face detection and mask detection.
Let's explore these sensors in detail, including their working mechanism and key features from their datasheets.

1. MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor
Overview:
The MLX90614 is a non-contact infrared temperature sensor used to measure the temperature of an object or body from a distance by detecting infrared radiation. It communicates with microcontrollers using the I2C protocol.
Working Principle:
The MLX90614 works by detecting the infrared radiation emitted by an object or body.
The sensor uses a thermopile sensor array to measure the temperature of the infrared radiation, which is then converted into a temperature reading.
The sensor operates in a contactless mode, making it ideal for body temperature measurements in health applications.
The sensor provides two outputs:
Ambient Temperature (the temperature of the environment)
Object Temperature (the temperature of the body or object being measured).
Important Features:
Non-contact measurement: Ideal for hygienic, safe, and fast temperature readings.
I2C Interface: Easy communication with microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi Pico.
High Accuracy: Typically ±0.5°C over a wide range of temperatures.
Wide Operating Range: Measures from -40°C to +85°C for ambient temperature and -70°C to +380°C for object temperature.
Key Points from the Datasheet:
Supply Voltage: 3.3V to 5V
Communication: I2C (SDA, SCL pins)
Accuracy: ±0.5°C (for object temperature) at 25°C
Response Time: Typically 50ms for stable reading
Operating Temperature Range: -40°C to 85°C (ambient temperature)
Resolution: 0.02°C
Output: 16-bit resolution, provides data for ambient and object temperature
Field of View: 35° (typical) for measuring body temperature
Working Example:
The sensor is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico via the SDA (GPIO 16) and SCL (GPIO 17) pins for I2C communication.
It continuously reads the temperature of the body and outputs it to the microcontroller, which can then compare it against a predefined threshold to determine whether access should be granted or denied.



2. Camera Module (USB or ESP32-CAM)
Overview:
The camera module captures images or video frames, which are then processed to detect the presence of a face and check if the person is wearing a mask. The ESP32-CAM is a common camera module used in such applications due to its low cost and built-in WiFi functionality. Alternatively, a USB camera can be used if connected to a Raspberry Pi or PC.
Working Principle:
ESP32-CAM: The ESP32-CAM module includes a camera sensor (OV2640) and the ESP32 microcontroller, which captures video or image frames and transmits them over WiFi or serial communication.
USB Camera: It connects via a USB interface (typically to a Raspberry Pi or PC) and outputs a video stream that can be processed by computer vision algorithms.
For face mask detection, we use OpenCV in Python to analyze the captured frames, detect faces, and classify whether they are wearing a mask or not using a pre-trained deep learning model.
Important Features:
Resolution: The ESP32-CAM supports image capture at up to 1600x1200 pixels, while a USB camera typically supports resolutions like 640x480 or 1280x720.
Image Processing: Captured images are processed for face detection and mask classification.
Output: Provides a video stream or still images that can be used for real-time detection.
Key Points from the Datasheet for ESP32-CAM (OV2640 Sensor):
Sensor: OV2640 CMOS sensor
Resolution: 2MP (1600x1200 pixels)
Frame Rate: 30fps at 640x480 resolution
Interface: UART or SPI for communication with Raspberry Pi Pico or microcontroller.
Power Supply: 5V via external power source or regulator.
Field of View: 65° horizontal angle of view.
Operating Voltage: 3.3V to 5V
Onboard Features: Built-in flash, microSD card slot for storing images (optional), and WiFi capability (for remote communication).
Working Example:
The ESP32-CAM is used to capture video frames of a person’s face. The captured frames are sent to the Raspberry Pi (or an external PC) for analysis using a deep learning model to detect the presence of a mask.
The model classifies the face as either "mask" or "no_mask" based on the image data.
For this, a MobileNetV2 model (trained with a dataset of mask and no-mask images) is used to classify the frames. The results are then passed to the access control logic.

Summary of Sensor Integration:
MLX90614 (Temperature Sensor):

Interface: I2C (GPIO 16 for SDA, GPIO 17 for SCL on Raspberry Pi Pico).
Function: Measures the object (body) and ambient temperature in a non-contact manner.
Data: Provides a temperature reading (in Celsius) for decision-making.
Camera Module (USB or ESP32-CAM):

Interface: USB or UART (depending on the camera).
Function: Captures images/video for processing face mask detection.
Data: Provides real-time video frames that are processed by the machine learning model to classify whether the person is wearing a mask or not.
Datasheets and Importance of Sensor Features

I2C Communication: Makes it easy to interface with microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi Pico.
Non-contact Measurement: Increases safety, especially in public or hygienic settings, as there is no direct contact required for temperature measurements.
ESP32-CAM Datasheet:

High Resolution (2MP): Allows clear and detailed image captures for face detection.

Built-in Flash: Useful for low-light conditions.
These datasheets provide the specifications that ensure these sensors can be used for real-time data collection (temperature and face detection), crucial for an automated system that grants or denies access based on health parameters.
