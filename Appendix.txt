# Face Mask Detection With Body Temperature Measurement

## Overview
This project aims to create a security system to verify health compliance (wearing face masks and checking body temperature) for entry into premises using a Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- MLX90614 IR Temperature Sensor
- USB Camera/ESP32-CAM for Face Mask Detection
- LCD/LED for output

## Software
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (Keras)
- MicroPython for Raspberry Pi Pico

## Installation
1. Install necessary libraries for TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MicroPython on your system.
2. Connect the hardware components as per the wiring diagram.
3. Run the code for mask detection and body temperature measurement.

## How it Works
1. The system captures an image for face mask detection.
2. It checks if the person is wearing a mask and if their temperature is below the threshold.
3. If both conditions are met, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied.
